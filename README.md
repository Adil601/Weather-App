This Weather App allows users to check the weather of any city in real time. The app features an interactive, user-friendly interface with the ability to switch between dark and light modes for enhanced visual experience. The key features of this project include:

1. Real-time Weather Data:
Users can enter a city name to fetch weather information using the OpenWeather API.
The app displays:
City Name and Country
Current Temperature (in Celsius)
Weather Description (like sunny, cloudy, etc.)
Humidity Level
If the city entered is not found or an error occurs, an appropriate error message is shown.

2. Dark and Light Mode Toggle:
The app supports both Dark Mode and Light Mode.
A toggle button is provided to switch between the two themes, allowing users to choose their preferred mode.
Dark Mode features a dark background with light-colored text, while Light Mode uses a white background with dark text for better readability in bright environments.
3. Responsive Design:
The app is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices and tablets.
The layout adjusts automatically, ensuring the user interface remains clean and easy to use across various screen sizes.
4. Modern User Interface (UI):
The app uses smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience. For instance, the theme change (light to dark and vice versa) is visually smooth.
The input fields and buttons are styled with modern CSS, providing an intuitive and attractive design.
Hover effects and focus styles are implemented to make interactions more engaging.
5. API Integration:
The app fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides up-to-date and accurate weather information.
The API call is made when the user submits the city name, and the results are displayed in the app interface.
6. Error Handling:
If the user enters an invalid city name or if there’s an issue with the API request, the app will display an error message, making it clear that the entered city couldn’t be found.
7. User-friendly Layout:
The app presents weather data in a clean, structured way with clear separation of information.
Input fields and buttons are placed logically, making it simple to search for weather details.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Markup for the structure of the app.
CSS: Styling to create the responsive layout and the dark/light theme toggle effects.
JavaScript: Handling user interactions, fetching data from the OpenWeather API, and implementing the light/dark mode toggle functionality.
OpenWeatherMap API: Fetching weather data based on the user's input.
Key Benefits:
User Experience (UX): The smooth transition between dark and light modes provides a pleasant experience for users who prefer different visual settings.
Accessibility: The app’s design considers users who prefer a dark mode interface, ensuring they can use the app comfortably in low-light environments.
Real-time Updates: The weather data is fetched and displayed in real-time, providing users with the latest weather conditions.
