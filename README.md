# Weather App

This **Weather App** allows users to check the weather of any city in real-time. The app features an interactive, user-friendly interface with the ability to switch between **Dark** and **Light** modes for an enhanced visual experience. Below are the key features and technologies used in this project:

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-time Weather Data**
- **City Name** and **Country** are displayed.
- **Current Temperature** (in Celsius) shown.
- **Weather Description** (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.).
- **Humidity Level** is displayed.
- If the city entered is not found or an error occurs, an appropriate error message is shown.

### 2. **Dark and Light Mode Toggle**
- The app supports **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**.
- A toggle button is provided to switch between the two themes, allowing users to choose their preferred mode.
- **Dark Mode** features a dark background with light-colored text, while **Light Mode** uses a white background with dark text, improving readability in bright environments.

### 3. **Responsive Design**
- The app is fully **responsive**, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices and tablets.
- The layout adjusts automatically, keeping the user interface clean and easy to navigate on all devices.

### 4. **Modern User Interface (UI)**
- Smooth **transitions** and **animations** enhance the user experience, especially the transition between light and dark modes.
- **Stylish input fields** and buttons are styled with modern CSS, making the app visually appealing and intuitive to use.
- **Hover effects** and **focus styles** are implemented to make interactions more engaging and intuitive.

### 5. **API Integration**
- Weather data is fetched using the **OpenWeatherMap API**, providing up-to-date and accurate weather information.
- The API call is made when the user submits a city name, and the results are displayed in the app interface in real time.

### 6. **Error Handling**
- If the user enters an invalid city name or if thereâ€™s an issue with the API request, the app will display an error message, indicating that the entered city could not be found.

### 7. **User-friendly Layout**
- The weather data is presented in a clean, structured way, with clear separation of information.
- Input fields and buttons are placed logically, making it simple for users to search for weather details without confusion.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styled the app with a modern, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user interactions, API calls, and theme toggling functionality.
